Open a pull request in this repository

### Step 2
Use the template of the pull request to fill in the information needed.

### Step 3
Use labels to show that you need help with something, perhaps finding
speakers or something else,

After everything is looking great and the community has had their say
you can merge the pull request which will automatically publish the event
